## Introduction
Quant is a domain-specific language (DSL) for acquiring and visualizing financial time series.

This language was created during the Domain-Specific Languages course at the Faculty of Technical Sciences, University of Novi Sad.

## Domain
<p align="justify">
    Quant language is used in the financial domain particularly in the stock markets. Stock prices change every day by market forces. The law of supply and demand affects the stock market. If demand for stocks is higher than supply, then the price moves up and vice versa. When supply exceeds demand for stocks, prices fall. In order to gain some profit, it is important to have the right data. This is the time when Quant language comes to the scene.
Quant language is used as a tool for financial data science. It collects structured stock market data in form of financial time series. Financial time series represent stock price movements during the time. Quant language also provides financial time series visualization. Acquiring and visualizing financial time series is very important for investment decision-makers because these pieces of information have a huge impact on profitability.
